                    <h6>PROBLEM</h6>
                    <h4>Why do some people opt out from taking care of house plants?</h4>
                    <p>At most stage of our lives, we take care of something, but even knowing its low investment, not many of us opt to take care of a plant, how come?<br><br>

                    Our explanatory research reveals that people get frustrated with their plant easily because it dies without telling you where went wrong. Plants are neither animate nor interactive, thus people won’t value them the same as pets. They feel indifferent when the plants die.

                    <p>Living space and routine lifestyle appeared frequently as a topic during our interview with the plant owners, so we decided to investigate what role do plants play in people’s personal space using two forms of generative research.
                    <br><br>
                    The first investigated the relationship of users and their living space, and the second looked at novice plant takers and their direct relationship with a new plant. With various activities, we expected to dig deeper into their personal experiences, which are sometimes hard to put into words and often inaccessible from interviews.

                        1. Can AI lower the barrier for the care-taking process, thus to help more people become opened up to plants?
                        <br>
                        2. Can we enhance the existing care taking relationship and foster a healthier environment, by leveraging known data?</p>
